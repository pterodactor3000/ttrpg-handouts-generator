description: Add a new vertical slice to context/foundation/roadmap.md with acceptance criteria, matching existing slice schema. Shows a roadmap preview and MCP issue-tracker preview, writes the slice on approval, then optionally creates a matching task via MCP (Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues). Issue titles use the // [S-NN]::[change-id] // conventional-commit prefix. Use when the user asks to add a roadmap slice, create a slice, alter the roadmap, or invokes rites-of-sanctified-alteration.

# Sanctified Alteration

## Initialization

The first emitted content on every invocation must be:

<div align="center">

_No task that is easy is ever worthwhile._

</div>

Then emit the applicable lifecycle header. Never omit, move, alter, or repeat this quote during the invocation.

## Cogitation Unit Output Protocol

Apply this protocol to every message emitted in chat. It applies only to agent chat output: do not alter generated artifacts, external issue or pull-request payloads, HTML markers, or parser-required schemas.

- Begin each substantial lifecycle message with `// [<RITE>] :: [<PHASE>] //`. All text between `[` and `]` is uppercase. End every `// [...] //` header and every labeled field with `<br>`. Chat markdown joins a plain newline into one paragraph.
- Use compact, procedural Cogitation Unit diction: state verified inputs, status, action, and result. Do not add decorative roleplay or obscure required actions.
- Use named sections where applicable: `// [<RITE>] :: [ANALYSIS] //`, `// [<RITE>] :: [PREVIEW] //`, `// [<RITE>] :: [FINDINGS] //`, `// [<RITE>] :: [SUMMARY] //`, `// [<RITE>] :: [FAILED] //`, and `// [NEXT DIRECTIVE] //`.
- Place every write approval in `// [AWAITING CONFIRMATION] //`, preserving the existing command words such as `approve`, `skip`, `yes`, and `no`.
- Report errors in `// [<RITE>] :: [FAILED] //` with the operation and decisive reason.
- End completed work with `// [NEXT DIRECTIVE] //` when a manual next step exists. Never invoke a downstream rite automatically.
- Separate rite and phase with ` :: `. Do not use em dashes.
- Follow [Cogitation Output Conventions](../conventions.md) for line layout, every input gate, confirmation, failure, and completion. This rite's roadmap and tracker schemas name the fields and sections. Line layout from that file always applies.

Use this skill when the user says "add a slice", "new roadmap slice", "create slice", "alter roadmap", or "rites-of-sanctified-alteration".

**Roadmap writes are forbidden until Step 6 approval. Issue creation is forbidden until Step 8 approval.**

## Workflow

1. **Locate artifacts**: read `context/foundation/roadmap.md` fully. Read `context/foundation/prd.md` when validating PRD refs. If roadmap is missing, stop and point at `/rites-of-rousing` unless the user supplies a path.
2. **Parse baseline**: list existing `S-NN` / `F-NN` IDs, slice body pattern, and `## At a glance` / `## Backlog Handoff` table shape from the live file. Next slice ID = highest `S-NN` + 1 (zero-padded).
3. **Intake**: gather fields per [slice-schema.md](references/slice-schema.md). Infer what you can from the user's message; ask for gaps under `// [SANCTIFIED ALTERATION] :: [COGITATION REQUIRED] //` with a numbered `Transmit:` list. **Always collect acceptance criteria** before preview (Step 4).
4. **Build draft**: assemble slice body, At a glance row, and Backlog Handoff row. Validate PRD refs against `prd.md` when available.
5. **Preview**: emit roadmap preview and issue-tracker preview (see Output Format). End with roadmap approval ask. **No tools in this turn.**
6. **Write roadmap**: on `approve`, insert slice in dependency order under `## Slices`, append At a glance and Backlog Handoff rows, bump roadmap frontmatter `updated`. Do not reorder unrelated slices.
7. **Issue gate**: after successful roadmap write, ask whether to create the matching MCP task. **Separate turn; wait for reply.**
8. **Create issue (optional)**: on `yes` / `create issue`, discover task-management MCP, read schemas, create issue with prefixed title and AC in description. Attach milestone/project when user named one or sync marker from sacred-fabrication exists.
9. **Summary**: report slice ID, files touched, issue identifier if created, and failures.

## Intake: Required Questions

Ask in compact Cogitation Unit chat (never `AskQuestion` during preview). Minimum before preview:

| Field                    | Required | Default                           |
| ------------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| Slice title              | yes      |:                                 |
| Outcome (`user can …`)   | yes      | derive from title                 |
| Change ID (kebab-case)   | yes      | propose from title                |
| Acceptance criteria      | **yes**  |:                                 |
| PRD refs (`FR-`, `US-`)  | yes      | warn if absent from PRD           |
| Prerequisites            | yes      | `:` if none                       |
| Status                   | no       | `proposed`                        |
| Risk                     | no       | one line from context             |
| Conventional-commit type | no       | `feat` unless fix/chore/docs fits |

Acceptance criteria format: prefer Given/When/Then bullets or a `#### Acceptance Criteria` checklist (≥ 2 items). Stored in the **issue description**, not in the roadmap slice body (schema has no AC field).

## Issue Title Format

Use this prefix **verbatim** on every created issue:

```
// [S-NN]::[change-id] // <type>: <description under 10 words><br>
```

| Part            | Rule                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `S-NN`          | Assigned slice ID                                                                    |
| `change-id`     | Kebab-case Change ID from slice                                                      |
| `<type>`        | Conventional commit type: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf` |
| `<description>` | Imperative, ≤ 10 words, no trailing period                                           |

Example: `// [S-04]::dashboard-tile-style // feat: themed header strip on dashboard`

## Approval Gates

### Gate 1: roadmap (after preview)

```
// [AWAITING CONFIRMATION] //<br>
Approve **roadmap slice S-NN**? Reply: `approve`, `skip`, or describe edits.<br>
```

- Default: no write.
- Never write roadmap in the same turn as preview.

### Gate 2: issue (after roadmap write)

```
// [AWAITING CONFIRMATION] //<br>
Create matching task in <provider>? Reply: `yes`, `no`, or `<team/project/milestone overrides>`.<br>
```

- Default: no issue.
- Skip Gate 2 when no task-management MCP is available: say so after roadmap write.

## Output Format

In emitted output, **all characters between `[` and `]` must be UPPERCASE** in section headers and labels. Issue title prefixes (`// [S-NN]::[change-id] //`) keep documented ID casing for tracker writes. Line layout follows [Cogitation Output Conventions](../conventions.md).

### Preview (before roadmap approval)

```text
// [SANCTIFIED ALTERATION] :: [PREVIEW] //<br>
Next ID: S-NN<br>
Change ID: <kebab-case><br>
Status: <proposed | ready | blocked><br>

// [ROADMAP] :: [AT A GLANCE ROW] //<br>
| S-NN | <change-id> | <outcome truncated> | <prerequisites> | <PRD refs> | <status> |

// [ROADMAP] :: [SLICE BODY] //<br>
### S-NN: <Slice title>

- **Outcome:** <user can …>
- **Change ID:** <change-id>
- **PRD refs:** <refs>
- **Prerequisites:** <refs or :>
- **Parallel with:** <IDs or :>
- **Blockers:** <external or :>
- **Unknowns:** <bullets or :>
- **Risk:** <one line>
- **Status:** <status>

// [ROADMAP] :: [BACKLOG HANDOFF ROW] //<br>
| S-NN | <change-id> | <suggested issue title sans prefix> | <yes | no> | <notes> |

// [ISSUE TRACKER PREVIEW] //<br>
Provider: <name or `none detected`><br>
Title: // [S-NN]::[change-id] // <type>: <≤10 words><br>
Team/Project: <inferred or `: specify on approve`><br>
Milestone: <inferred or :><br>
Description:<br>
## Outcome
<one line><br>

## Acceptance Criteria
<user-supplied AC><br>

## Roadmap
- Slice: S-NN
- Change ID: <change-id>
- PRD refs: <refs>
- Prerequisites: <refs>

Approve **roadmap slice S-NN**? Reply: `approve`, `skip`, or describe edits.<br>
```

Preview rules:

- Slice body must match an existing slice's field order and markdown shape exactly.
- Issue title uses the full prefix; Backlog Handoff `Suggested issue title` column stays **without** the prefix (human-readable short title).
- If PRD refs are not in `prd.md`, note `(?)` in preview: still allow if user confirms.

### Summary (after execution)

```text
// [ALTERATION SUMMARY] //<br>
Slice: S-NN<br>
Change ID: <change-id><br>
Executed: <YYYY-MM-DD><br>

// [ROADMAP] //<br>
roadmap.md: <updated | skipped><br>

// [ISSUE] //<br>
<IDENTIFIER>: <created | skipped>: <title><br>
… or `None: user declined or no MCP.`

// [FAILED] //<br>
<item>: <reason><br>
… or `None.`
```

## Streams Note

New slices do not auto-edit `## Streams`. After write, if the slice belongs to an obvious stream chain, tell the user which stream row to extend: or offer a follow-up edit if they reply with stream letter.
