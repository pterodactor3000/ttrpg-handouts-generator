# Triage Rules

Defaults for classifying issues after normalizing to the common shape. Override per team after reading actual labels and statuses from MCP.

## Common issue shape

Every provider maps to:

| Field | Used for |
| ----- | -------- |
| `identifier` | Report lines |
| `title` | Report lines |
| `stateName` / `stateType` | Active vs done vs canceled; review-ready |
| `labels` | Blocked, review, out-of-scope, radar |
| `priority` | Recommendations ranking |
| `assignee` | Scope and out-of-radar |
| `updatedAt` | Staleness |
| `cycleOrSprint` | Recommendations and out-of-radar |
| `blockingRelations` | Blocked (when provider exposes them) |

## Blocked

Match when **any** of:

- Label (case-insensitive): `blocked`, `blocker`, `waiting`, `waiting-on`, `dependency`
- State name contains: `blocked`, `waiting`
- Unresolved blocking relation from provider (e.g. "blocked by", "depends on" link to open issue)
- Title or description starts with `[blocked]` or `[waiting on]`

## Review ready

Match when **any** of:

- State name (case-insensitive): `in review`, `review`, `ready for review`, `in qa`, `qa`, `ready to merge`, `pending review`
- Label: `review`, `review-ready`, `needs-review`, `ready-for-review`

Exclude items also marked blocked.

## Out of scope

Match when **any** of:

- State type/name: `canceled`, `cancelled`, `duplicate`, `wontfix`, `won't fix`
- Label: `out-of-scope`, `out of scope`, `wontfix`, `won't do`, `deferred`, `icebox` (when explicitly marked as won't do)
- Title prefix: `[oos]`, `[out of scope]`, `[wontfix]`

Done/completed states are excluded from the report entirely, not listed here.

## Out of radar

Match active in-scope issues **not** already in Blocked, Review ready, or Recommended, when **any** of:

- Label: `radar`, `off-radar`, `someday`, `icebox`, `backlog` (and not in current cycle)
- No assignee for **> 7 days** since last update
- Last updated **> 14 days** ago while still in an active (non-backlog) state
- Not in the current cycle/sprint and priority is None or Low

Cap this section at **10 items**; prefer oldest `updatedAt` first. Mention truncation: `… and N more off radar.`

## Active states

Treat as active (eligible for radar / recommendations): anything that is not Done, Canceled, or Duplicate. Resolve exact names via the provider's status-list tool — do not hardcode team-specific state IDs.

## Staleness

| Threshold | Use |
| --------- | --- |
| 7 days | unassigned → out of radar candidate |
| 14 days | assigned but untouched → out of radar candidate |

Adjust if the user specifies a sprint length or SLA.
